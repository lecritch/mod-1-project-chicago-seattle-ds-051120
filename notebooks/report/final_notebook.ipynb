    "# Analysis Part 3:\n",
    "In Part 3 of this analysis, we present updates on the \"Opportunity Youth Status by Age\" table from the 2016 report \"Opportunity Youth in the Road Map Project Region\".\n",
    " \n",
    "We also highlight the discrepancies that are present between the two data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data attained in this part of the analysis was queried in the same way as previously mentioned in part 2, so the lines of code used to select these figures from the dataframe has been omitted to avoid repitition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we take a look at the 2014 data, as reported in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Table from 2016 Report:\n",
    "![2016_table.png](../../reports/figures/2016_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the specifics are unclear as to how the 2016 report defined the South King County region.  We believe this had an effect on the total population size that was reported.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further to this, the 2016 report did not include people who were 'working without a diploma' in the 'Non-Opportunity Youth' category.  This conflicted with our definition of what constitutes an Opportunity Youth and so we chose to include 'working without a diploma' persons in our count for 'Non-Opportunity Youth' persons.  You will see in our updated table that we have shared the number of people who are working without a diploma, however, these people were already counted in our 'Not an Opportunity Youth' count, so we did not add them to our total counts to avoid double counting them.  \n",
    "# Table from 2020 Report:\n",
    "![2020_table.png](../../reports/figures/2020_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the significant difference between the size of the population reported in 2016 versus the size of the population we have calculated can be attributed to how we defined South King County.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the tables, a similarity between the proprtion of the populations is evident.  For example, in the 2016 report, 13% of the total (16-24yo) population was reported as Opportunity Youth.  Similarily, we have found that 12% of the total (16-24yo) population was Opportunity Youth.  This can be seen in the bar graph below where we also highlight the similarities in the proportions of OY by each age group across the two reporting years:\n",
    "\n",
    "![perc_totpop.png](../../reports/figures/perc_totpop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see that the distribution of age groups is also fairly similar between the 2014 data and 2017 data.  As was noted in part 2 of this analysis, there is an upward trend in the OY population by age; that is, the lowest portion of the population is the 16-18yo and the highest portion lies in the 22-24yo group.  We see a similar trend in the 2014 data as can be seen here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![16vs20_perc.png](../../reports/figures/16vs20_p.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "In part 3 of this analysis, we discussed the similarities between the 2016 findings and our own.  We saw that while the sampling region of the two reports differed, resulting in a larger reported population for the 2016 report, the **proportions** of the OY population remained much the same between the 2014 and 2017 data.

    "- The 2017 pums data table gave us access to 286 features relating to (weighted) individual persons.  \n",

    "    - 'Age' - this feature allows us to isolate the relevant age range of the OY pop.\n",
    "    - 'Employment Status' - this allows us to query the employment status of an individual so that if they aren't employed **and** not in school, we can categorise them as OY \n",
    "    - 'School Enrollment' - this allows us to query the school enrollment of an individual (same as above)\n",
    "    - 'Person Weights' - since this was just a sample of the skc population, it was important to include this feature in order to get the correct person-weighting scaling of the data\n",
    "    - We also used the 'serialno' feature as an 'id' identifier for each row\n",
    "- Since OY are defined by employment and education, it seemed fitting to include more features relating to those two fields, as they might prove useful throughout our exploration.  Thus, we also chose to include:\n",
    "    - 'Grade Attending' - this would help us if we wanted more insight on the non-oy pop for comparison sake\n",
    "    - 'Education Attained' - this would help us see the distribution of what levels of education OYs have obtained\n",
    "    - 'Absent from work' - this allows us to investigate further into the OY that may be unemployed but may just be absent from work\n",
    "    - 'Available for work' - this will allow us to query how many OY are available for work in comparison to the non-oy pop and if there are any significant differences between the 2 pops\n",
    "    - 'Looking for work' - this will allow us to investigate how many OY are actively searching for work (again in comparison to non-oy) and how many are unemployed and not looking for work\n",
    "    - 'Layoff from work' - this feature will let us see how many OY may be on layoff from work. \n",
    "- We of course had to also include the 'puma' feature so that we could refine our data set to SKC as per the puma codes we found from the puma_names_2010 table \n",
    "- Note that we also updated the column names to something more readable\n",
    "- We then filtered down to the appropriate OY age range:  16-24, so that our data set only contained individuals who were between 16 and 24"

It is important to note that all values in our dataframe, except 'age' and 'person weight', are strings, despite most of the response options in the survey being integer answers.  This matters because now the format of how we query each response is important.  For the 'education attainment' feature, responses 'bb' through to '15' were valid responses to mean a person had no diploma.  At first, we were making queries using the `range(1, 16)` function and then casting the values as a list.  After querying the data in this way, we noticed that we had missed a lot of the data.  Upon further investigation into the format of the response data, we saw that single-digit responses in the 'education attainment' column were listed with a '0' before the number, e.g. '01' rather than '1'.  This meant our `range()` function was missing all single-digit responses:"

    "Further to this, the 2016 report did not include people who were 'working without a diploma' in the 'Non-Opportunity Youth' category.  This conflicted with our definition of what constitutes an Opportunity Youth and so we chose to include 'working without a diploma' persons in our count for 'Non-Opportunity Youth' persons.  You will see in our updated table that we have shared the number of people who are working without a diploma, however, these people were already counted in our 'Not an Opportunity Youth' count, so we did not add them to our total counts to avoid double counting them.  \n",

For example, in the 2016 report, 13% of the total (16-24yo) population was reported as Opportunity Youth.  Similarily, we have found that 12% of the total (16-24yo) population was Opportunity Youth.

As was noted in part 2 of this analysis, there is an upward trend in the OY population by age; that is, the lowest portion of the population is the 16-18yo and the highest portion lies in the 22-24yo group.  We see a similar trend in the 2014 data as can be seen here.  \n",

We saw that while the sampling region of the two reports differed, resulting in a larger reported population for the 2016 report, the **proportions** of the OY population remained much the same between the 2014 and 2017 data.
