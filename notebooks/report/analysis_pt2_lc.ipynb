It is important to note that all values in our dataframe, except 'age' and 'person weight', are strings, despite most of the response options in the survey being integer answers.  This matters because now the format of how we query each response is important.  For the 'education attainment' feature, responses 'bb' through to '15' were valid responses to mean a person had no diploma.  At first, we were making queries using the `range(1, 16)` function and then casting the values as a list.  After querying the data in this way, we noticed that we had missed a lot of the data.  Upon further investigation into the format of the response data, we saw that single-digit responses in the 'education attainment' column were listed with a '0' before the number, e.g. '01' rather than '1'.  This meant our `range()` function was missing all single-digit responses:"

This is not too surprising given that people between 16-18 years old are 'school aged', so it is typical to see 16-18yo without a diploma.
