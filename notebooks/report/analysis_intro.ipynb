    "- The 2017 pums data table gave us access to 286 features relating to (weighted) individual persons.  \n",

    "- We first chose the features that would help us define the OY population.  This included selecting the features:\n",
    "    - 'Age' - this feature allows us to isolate the relevant age range of the OY pop.\n",
    "    - 'Employment Status' - this allows us to query the employment status of an individual so that if they aren't employed **and** not in school, we can categorise them as OY \n",
    "    - 'School Enrollment' - this allows us to query the school enrollment of an individual (same as above)\n",
    "    - 'Person Weights' - since this was just a sample of the skc population, it was important to include this feature in order to get the correct person-weighting scaling of the data\n",
    "    - We also used the 'serialno' feature as an 'id' identifier for each row\n",
    "- Since OY are defined by employment and education, it seemed fitting to include more features relating to those two fields, as they might prove useful throughout our exploration.  Thus, we also chose to include:\n",
    "    - 'Grade Attending' - this would help us if we wanted more insight on the non-oy pop for comparison sake\n",
    "    - 'Education Attained' - this would help us see the distribution of what levels of education OYs have obtained\n",
    "    - 'Absent from work' - this allows us to investigate further into the OY that may be unemployed but may just be absent from work\n",
    "    - 'Available for work' - this will allow us to query how many OY are available for work in comparison to the non-oy pop and if there are any significant differences between the 2 pops\n",
    "    - 'Looking for work' - this will allow us to investigate how many OY are actively searching for work (again in comparison to non-oy) and how many are unemployed and not looking for work\n",
    "    - 'Layoff from work' - this feature will let us see how many OY may be on layoff from work. \n",
    "- We of course had to also include the 'puma' feature so that we could refine our data set to SKC as per the puma codes we found from the puma_names_2010 table \n",
    "- Note that we also updated the column names to something more readable\n",
    "- We then filtered down to the appropriate OY age range:  16-24, so that our data set only contained individuals who were between 16 and 24"
