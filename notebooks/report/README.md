### **Part 1:**
To begin the analysis of the South King County (SKC) and the Opportunity youth (OY) within SKC. We first needed to identify those two parameters. Starting with SKC we are looked at the 2010 Public Use Micro Area [(PUMA)](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-maps/2000/geo/2000-pumas.html) codes to see how the census determined south and King County (KC). Using this information and along with the Public Use Microdata Samples [(PUMS)](https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/search?ds=ACSPUMS1Y2018&rv=ucgid&g=7950000US5311612,5311613,5311614,5311615) we filtered through the geographic locations considered south by the census and matched those corresponding areas with their respective PUMA codes. Now understanding where our OP are located and what area of KC we are looking at we then needed a way to represent this data visually. To do this we utilized [GIS oranizations shapefiles](https://www.psrc.org/gis-shapefiles) and the [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/install.html) library. After plotting the shapefile for KC, it was then time to create SKC plot that would overlay the KC visual. To do this we utilized the prior mentioned PUMA codes to isolate the specific areas considered South. After that was completed SKC was figure was used as and overlay to then create the entire SKC graph.
