# Analysis Part 3:
In Part 3 of this analysis, we present updates on the "Opportunity Youth Status by Age" table from the 2016 report "Opportunity Youth in the Road Map Project Region".
 
We also highlight the discrepancies that are present between the two data sets.

First, we take a look at the 2014 data, as reported in 2016.

# Table from 2016 Report:

As mentioned earlier, the specifics are unclear as to how the 2016 report defined the South King County region.  We believe this had an effect on the total population size that was reported.  

Further to this, the 2016 report did not include people who were 'working without a diploma' in the 'Non-Opportunity Youth' category.  This conflicted with our definition of what constitutes an Opportunity Youth and so we chose to include 'working without a diploma' persons in our count for 'Non-Opportunity Youth' persons.  You will see in our updated table that we have shared the number of people who are working without a diploma, however, these people were already counted in our 'Not an Opportunity Youth' count, so we did not add them to our total counts to avoid double counting them.  
# Table from 2020 Report:
![2020_table.png](../../reports/figures/2020_table.png)

Firstly, the significant difference between the size of the population reported in 2016 versus the size of the population we have calculated can be attributed to how we defined South King County.  

When comparing the tables, a similarity between the proprtion of the populations is evident.  For example, in the 2016 report, 13% of the total (16-24yo) population was reported as Opportunity Youth.  Similarily, we have found that 12% of the total (16-24yo) population was Opportunity Youth.  This can be seen in the bar graph below where we also highlight the similarities in the proportions of OY by each age group across the two reporting years:

We can also see that the distribution of age groups is also fairly similar between the 2014 data and 2017 data.  As was noted in part 2 of this analysis, there is an upward trend in the OY population by age; that is, the lowest portion of the population is the 16-18yo and the highest portion lies in the 22-24yo group.  We see a similar trend in the 2014 data as can be seen here.

# Summary
In part 3 of this analysis, we discussed the similarities between the 2016 findings and our own.  We saw that while the sampling region of the two reports differed, resulting in a larger reported population for the 2016 report, the **proportions** of the OY population remained much the same between the 2014 and 2017 data.
